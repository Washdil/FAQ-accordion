## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Use HTML to structure the FAQs with `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` tags for question-answer pairs.
2. Apply CSS styling to enhance the layout and readability of the FAQs section, making it visually appealing.
3. Employ JavaScript for interactivity, such as toggling visibility to show/hide answers when questions are clicked, enhancing user experience.

Learnings:
- HTML provides semantic elements for structuring content, like definition lists (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`).
- CSS is essential for styling and improving the visual presentation of web content.
- JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing for dynamic features like collapsible FAQ sections, enhancing user engagement.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
